# Code Hub for Pima Community College 
A centralized home for small, reusuable cod eproejcts at Pima Community College
covering teaching demos, course utilities, and department/admin scripts. Think of 
this repo as a tidy toolbox: each folder is a self-contained module with its own
short README and examples.
